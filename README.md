# Hello-World
First try at making a repository .... doesn't hurt yet ~
I've had Git for some time now, thought I should try it out.
I can use something to help keep things organized.
....
Back after nine months.  Trying to see which online resources work best for me.  
I'm trying to get back into programming.  Loved low level coding in the DOS days.
Have a Raspberry Pi as a gift and I love it!  SD cards are a drag but I have been able to boot with just the bootcode.bin file
on the SD card and the file system on USB.  Not very stable and the pure SD runs faster.
